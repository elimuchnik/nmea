VisualGPS

VisualGPS (Freeware) incorporates many advanced features found in professional programs.
Its sole purpose is to display graphically specific NMEA 0183 sentences and show the effects of selective availability (SA).

Features:

1.Azimuth and Elevation Graph - View all satellites that are in view. Each satellite identifies its pseudo random number (PRN) 
and its azimuth and elevation. Also plot and print  the physical mask angle.

2.Survey - The survey window displays both position and xDOP (HDOP and VDOP) parameters.
The ability for user selectable HDOP/VDOP color thresholds for position averaging make a great utility.
Also monitor Standard Deviation and effects of Selective Availability. That's not all - print the results graphically.

3.Signal Quality/SNR Window - Monitor satellite signal to noise ratios and see them graphically on the screen.
The signal quality window will grow or shrink to accommodate number of satellites in view
4.Navigation - Monitor latitude, longitude and altitude
5.NMEA Command Monitor - View NMEA sentences as they are received



GOODLE EARTH

Google Earth displays satellite images of varying resolution of the Earth's surface,
allowing users to see things like cities and houses looking perpendicularly down or at an oblique angle (see also bird's eye view).
The degree of resolution available is based somewhat on the points of interest and popularity, 
but most land (except for some islands) is covered in at least 15 meters of resolution.
Maps showing a visual representation of Google Earth coverage Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; and Cambridge,
Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom include examples of the highest resolution, at 15 cm (6 inches).
Google Earth allows users to search for addresses for some countries, enter coordinates, 
or simply use the mouse to browse to a location.
For large parts of the surface of the Earth only 2D images are available, from almost vertical photography. 
Viewing this from an oblique angle, there is perspective in the sense that objects which are horizontally far away are seen smaller,
like viewing a large photograph, not quite like a 3D view.
For other parts of the surface of the Earth, 3D images of terrain and buildings are available.
Google Earth uses digital elevation model (DEM) data collected by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM).
[12] This means one can view almost the entire earth in three dimensions.
Since November 2006, the 3D views of many mountains, including Mount Everest, have been improved by the use of supplementary DEM data to fill the gaps in SRTM coverage.
